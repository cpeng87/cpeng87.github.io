Willow is a top-down 2D pixel art game, developed using Unity and C# as a part of VgDev, the video game development club at Georgia Tech. As a member of the team, I contributed as an pixel artist for the game's title screen. This game is created with the help of a team of 40 students with different interests and concentrations and was one of the first VgDev games to be demo-ed at Dreamhack Atlanta!
