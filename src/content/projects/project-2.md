Back to Bassics is a 3D rhythm game, developed using Unity and C# as a part of VgDev, the video game development club at Georgia Tech. As a member of the team, I contributed as an concept artist for the game's enemies and NPCs. This game is created with the help of a team of 25 students with different interests and concentrations and will be finished and demo-ed at the end of the Fall 2024 semester.
