Altarune is a top-down 3D game, developed using Unity and C# as a part of VgDev, the video game development club at Georgia Tech. As a member of the team, I contributed as an artist, 3D modeler, and designer to the game's enemies. This game is created with the help of a team of 50 students with different interests and concentrations and will be finished and demo-ed at the end of the Fall 2024 semester.
