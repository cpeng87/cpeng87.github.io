I am the sole developer, artist, designer, writer, and musician for this game. FOr this project, I used a prexisting tileset for the art, and added tiles for my own needs in the game. I have written the game architecture from scratch in Unity and designed and implemented the UI as well as each of the mechanics into the game through the use of C# scripts in Unity. I hope to be able to complete the game by the end of 2025 and to be able to present the game at Dreamhack Atlanta!
